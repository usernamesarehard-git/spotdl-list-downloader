# spotdl-list-downloader
i got tired of typing the spotdl command so here

paste your spotify links in the playlist.txt (one line for each link) and run the spotdl_G.
only good thing is you can have it in the background and forget about it.

playlist link WON'T work and song will be downloaded in the directory where spotdl_G is.
